# Reddit Retractable Sidebar

If you do a lot of split screen redditing, you'll quickly find that the sidebar can be a nuisance. Well, this script makes that sidebar retractable.

It adds a FAB button to the right-hand side of the screen which allows you to hide or show the sidebar. It will add a cookie remembering the sidebar's last position so that you can browse the site without continually hiding it.

You can install the script by going to [the script's page on GreasyFork](https://greasyfork.org/en/scripts/19638-reddit-retractable-sidebar).

As of version 0.4 you can toggle the sidebar by pressing "q".
