# Reddit Retractable Sidebar

If you do a lot of split screen redditing, you'll quickly find that the sidebar can be a nuisance. Well, this Tampermonkey script makes that sidebar retractable.

It adds a FAB button to the right-hand side of the screen which allows you to hide or show the sidebar. It will add a cookie remembering the sidebar's last position so that you can browse the site without continually hiding it.

I don't know much about distributing Tampermonkey scripts, so I'm not sure how to go about this. For now I've just placed all my files in this repository. For now, you can just import the script by downloading [**this zip file**](mca62511.github.io/reddit-retractable-sidebar/tmScripts.zip) and importing it via the Tampermonkey extension.
